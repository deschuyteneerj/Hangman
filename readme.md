# Hangman

## Creation of a hangman game

While learning Javascript, i tried to understand the language by creating a hangman game.

## Instructions

At the very least your version of the hangman should:

    - propose an hidden word
    - allow the selection of letters
    - verify if a selected letter belongs to the word
    - count the number of failure (lives)
    - check if it's a game over
    - check if the word as been found

Optionally it can:

    - keep in memory all guessed letters
    - only let the player guess a letter once

Bonus:

    - use canvas
